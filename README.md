# native-test

# 1. Sorry, but I don't have ios devices, only android works
# 2. I don't use Formik, Redux, Redux-persist because I don't see the point in including a whole library for this application
# 3. Used by Firebase instead AsyncStorage and Redux-persist to store card data (only Android)
# 4. Used styled-components to style components

## To run the application, follow the instructions on the official documentation to install the environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
## To run `npm install` and `npx react-native run-android` to run the app
